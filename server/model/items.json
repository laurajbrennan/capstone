    "description": "Up for grabs! One cast-iron waffle maker, the old- fashioned kind you hold over a fire or your stovetop and it makes one waffle at a time. Got it at a garage sale, used it once. One older, but still very functional, immersion blender. Breville brand, still works great. Four assorted teacups and saucers, not matching but in complimentary colours. Three metal spatula and one metal ladle. I can meet anywhere in Kits, or near Waterfront Stn downtown in work hours.",
