## Waste Not

This capstone project was created by Laura Brennan for the completion of the Web Development Diploma Program at BrainStation.

I created this app because I love the Freecycle network and zero-waste ethos, but I noticed that their [website](https://www.freecycle.org) is pretty outdated - it's nonresponsive, very difficult to use on anything smaller than a desktop computer screen, and not very pretty. I decided to base my project on Freecycle - i.e. a message board-style application that allows users to post about items they want, or items they have and would like to offer up for grabs - but focus on making it mobile-first, tablet-friendly, and stylish in its simplicity.

## Project Specs

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br />I used React and React Router Dom to write the front end, while my server is Express.js and Node.js. My next project steps will be migrating my data from the built-in JSON models to a MySQL database.

## Credits

The education team on BrainStation's Vancouver campus are truly excellent humans, and I can't thank them enough for all their help and support in turning myself into a developer. To Noor, Jim, Parvaneh and Russell - Thank you. You're amazing.

I also found this Net Ninja Youtube code-along introducing the React Context API and Hooks to be immensely valuable in my build process; check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hNokByJilPg5g9m2APUePI)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode. Run this once you navigate into the server file on your terminal.<br />
The app will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), while the API will host at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
